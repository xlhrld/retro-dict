# retro-dict
`retro-dict` is a collection of historical etymological dictionaries.

Transcription and typographical markup follow the guidelines
of the DTA base format which was developed for the _German Text Archive_
(DTA, https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de) on the basis of the
TEI P5 guidelines (Text Encoding Initiative, https://www.tei-c.org).
You can find the upstream version of the DTA base format
(schema and documentation in ODD) at
https://github.com/deutschestextarchiv/dtabf. `retro-dict` keeps
an unmodified set schemas (Relax NG and Schematron, under `share/validation`)
for convenience and easier off-line use of the collection's data.
