- mentioned wordforms in Greek script are never typeset italic
(this even leads to mixing of italics and recte in headwords,
e. g. for Hebrew transliterations); individual Greek characters embedded in italic Latin script is also transcribed as italic (contrary to the print)
- Cyrillic soft signs in Russian transliterations are represented as ' (U+0027 APOSTROPHE) in print; this is conserved in the transcription
